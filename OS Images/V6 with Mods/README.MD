This is the unixv6.dsk image from the main OS image directory with a couple of tweaks:

1. Added myself as a user (chloe, no password)
2. Added some extra tools/programs from 2BSD (inc. csh, whoami)
3. Added shutdown and halt commands (must have processor modded to enable user halt)
4. cshrc scripts for user chloe to set tty to allow upper and lower case and set username prompt
5. User chloe logs into csh instead of sh (Thompson), root still uses sh
