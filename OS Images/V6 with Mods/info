This is the unixv6.dsk image from the main directory with a couple of tweaks:
1. Added myself as a user (chloe)
2. Added csh shell from 2BSD (and setenv, though faulty)
3. Added shutdown and halt commands (must have processor modded to enable user halt)
4. Login and csh-init scripts for user chloe to set tty to allow upper and lower case
5. User chloe logs into csh instead of sh (Thompson)
