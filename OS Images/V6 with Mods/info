This is the unixv6.dsk image from the main directory with a couple of tweaks:
1. Added myself as a user (chloe)
2. Added csh shell from 2BSD (and setenv, though faulty)
3. Added shutdown and halt commands (must have processor modded to enable user halt)
4. cshrc scripts for user chloe to set tty to allow upper and lower case and set username prompt
5. User chloe logs into csh instead of sh (Thompson)
6. Added whomai command
