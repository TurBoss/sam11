## Why sam11?

The world's first ever PDP-11 simulator was written for the PDP-10 before the PDP-11 was ever built, it was called SIM11. Add that to this program was originally just going to be a fork of AVR11 for SAM boards (it became way more)... and well, the name was obvious!

## General info

[Todo list](TODO)

The sam11 software is a cross-platform MCU implementation for software emulation of a PDP-11/40\* and some of the supporting hardware. \
\* = With some PDP-11/45 and other model stuff thrown in...

The initial code "skeleton", processor instruction functions, RK11, and mmu is based on a fork of Dave Cheney's avr11 simulator. Avr11 was a port of Aiju's JS PDP-11/40 emulator to AVR MCUs. However, the code was almost completely re-written from avr11 (where code was derived, see [AUTHORS](AUTHORS)) based on actual PDP physical structure, device names, and data paths from the PDP-11/40 processor handbook in order to be more useful for learning the system, though there is still work to do, especially around MMU and FIS/FP11 processing. Sam11 is also inspired/informed by various other emulators such as Aiju's js emulator, simh, PiDP, and nankervis js emulator, but it does not derive any code from them.

The altered structure for hardware modules should allow implementing the missing hardware modules easier to allow use of operating systems and configurations that rely on currently unimplemented hardware features or devices. See pdp1140.h for more information about file names/splits and pdp-11/40 device structure.

The original avr11 software supported UNIXv6, and this does as well. UNIX V6 (of Lion's fame) runs, but some programs (e.g. bc and chess) fail to run correctly due to emulator bugs. Most things appear good. You can even compile c programs! As of 2021-09-17 some other OSes boot, but crash out for various reasons. The 2.9 BSD image accidentally ID's the processor as an 11/45 and crashes because of that... so either the strict 11/40 mode needs making stricter or we need to finish making it a full 11/45.

## Modifications

The 11/40 functionality is ever so slightly Modded over a standard 11/40:

1. FIS instructions were added, but only to suppress the no-op trap, otherwise they don't do anything
2. The HALT instruction is modified to allow user and supervisor operation, this was so that a simple shutdown command could be added to OSes without that functionality
3. The KW11 line clock when in LKS_SHIFT_TICK mode simply assumes 1 Op/Step = 1us, which is highly inaccurate on most system (there are options for better accuracy)
4. A simple break, step, continue debugger is implemented, but requires you to enable it in sam11.h and enable PRINTSIMLINES

## Supported virtual hardware

### The core system, modules which cannot be disabled, consists of

1. MS11 248KiB RAM interface
2. KT11 MMU
3. KL11 serial console (the main serial terminal/tty)
4. KD11 or KB11 CPU (11/40 or 45 dependent)
5. KE11-E EIS (extended instructions)
6. KW11 line clock, DD11 UNIBUS "backplane"
7. RK11 disk drive interface for RK05 disks

#### RK11

The RK11 currently supports up to 4 disks, but can be altered to include more or fewer with a single #define. The disks are simply binary files on a microSD card, which are processed as raw bytes from the image as the hosted system reads and writes. The images should be the full size (4872 blocks of 512 bytes: 2,494,464 bytes) but I have yet to see problems when running under-sized images.

In theory, UNIX uses the unallocated free blocks at the end of a drive as swap space, and not allowing this could cause programs or the system to crash.

Luckily, being just SD card images, we don't have to worry about problems like this! Just keep your fingers clean ;)

### As optional modules the emulator also supports

### The following modules are WIP, but will be supported

1. RL11 disk drive interface for RL01 and RL02 disks
2. FP11 floating point processor
   a. KE11-F FIS (floating instructions), a different kind of FPP
3. KY11 front panel console
4. DL11 16-channel serial interface (to expand number of TTYs)
5. KJ11 stack limit register

### Currently planned modules to be added

1. RP11 and RP04 interfaces for at least RP04 and RP06 disks
2. DELUA or DEUNA ethernet network interface

## Line Clock Options

Note that the LKS module on the PDP-11 was _never_ the most accurate clock, and there is actually a KW11-P model that has an RTC which UNIX will use if found first. This is because the LKS is simply based on created an interrupt at the mains supply frequency (and the noise generated by it).

There are 3 options in my code for producing this tick, depending on the accuracy required.

1. LKS_SHIFT_TICK -> This is the original mechanism used by avr11 and Aiju, and simply creates the interrupt at a fix rate of every 16384 CPU steps/instructions. The drift caused by this is highly dependent on the MIPS your processor can produce. At 1 mips it is most accurate.

2. LKS_LOW_ACC -> This uses the arduino elapsedMillis class/library to produce the interrupt on a fixed 16ms interval. It is not accurate, but it will be more consistent board-to-board than LKS_SHIFT_TICK and is less dependent on mips

3. LKS_HIGH_ACC -> This uses the arduino elapsedMicros class/library to produce the interrupt on a fixed 16.580ms interval. This is not exactly 60Hz (16.667ms), but is ever so slightly faster. Whilst not RTC perfect, it will create a timer close enough that you can use the clock or date commands in Unix fairly accurately. It has ONLY been calibrated for SAMD51P20A processors using the suggested compile options below and may not be accurate on others.

When it comes to performance, 3 uses up more processing time, 2 the next most, and 1 is the least intensive. If you just want to get it working, then use LKS_SHIFT_TICK

If the LKS_ACC macro is not defined, it will revert to LKS_SHIFT_TICK

There is an option in kw11.cpp, of LKS_COMPROMISE. When set to non-0 (and < 16384) this essentially offers a combined LKS_SHIFT_TICK and other options, allowing you to use a loop/step counter as the trigger to check whether it is time to send another interrupt. If 0, it is disabled

## Installation

The software is designed to be programmed to a device using the arduino IDE .ino file, or other compatible editors/IDEs.

Because different boards all have different options for where the PDP ram lives, how much, and what pins for LEDs/CSs there is a file platform.h which is used to define these variables, along with a corresponding platform.cpp file which actuates some of these physical parts. You will need to add new information for chips not currently implemented.

The RAM type is defined in platform.h, and depending the options different cpp files are inserted into ms11.cpp from the ram_opt folder cpp.h files.

If you wish to use this as tested without defining a new board, you will need an Adafruit Grand Central M4, microSD card, and USB cable; alternativley a Teensy 4.1 board will work.

Put the .dsk images from the OS Images folder onto the root of your SD card, without renaming.
Plug the board into your computer, and using the arduino IDE (or compatible, e.g. vscode) compile and upload the sam11.ino file. This should automatically include all the cpp files and headers necessary.

Then simply open up the terminal/serial, type "0." to select the UnixV6 image, type "unix" at the '@' to boot.

Expect a trap at 0760000 as this is by design and is Unix discovering the maximum RAM available (248KB).

On an Adafruit Grand Central (SAMD51P20A), I suggest compile options: with Cache Enabled, 200MHz CPU Clock, "Fastest" or "Dragon" optimisation.

## Performance

On a real PDP-11/40 or 11-45, the fastest complete operation is a CLR on Reg 0, with a cycle time of 0.99us (from the DEC handbooks). This translates to a instructions speed of approx. 1 MIPS. The PDP-11/70 has a recorded speed of 2-2.5 MIPS (Microsoft's Miss Piggy), and the VAX 11/780 has a recorded speed of 1 MIPS when running PDP-11 code (Wikipedia).

On a SAMD51P20A (PDP using Internal RAM, 200MHz Clock, Cache enabled) the emulated processor operates with a MIPS of 0.5->0.75 when measuring from inside UNIX V6 in multiuser. I you boot up my modified V6 you will find a note in the root directory along those lines, along with a command 'mips' to test it yourself (usage: "time mips"). This makes the simulator a bit slower than a real PDP-11/40, but it's close enough that it feels like you get to experience the processor at it's real speed, in fact, performance seems better than other emulators locked to a real 1MIPS (proof that MIPS isn't everything?). On that note, it is actually pretty amazingly fast, UNIX V6 boots faster than many modern CLI systems!

On a SAMD21G18A, using the swapfile as RAM, the emulated processor.... is too slow to be worth using, 5 seconds per character print slow... Still, I tried it, and the SAMD21G18A did successfully boot UNIX V6 and compile a program, it's just agonising to use.

The AVR (ATmega2560) has NOT been tried, but the software should compile back to something close-to avr11 with similar performance; Dave Cheney reported a MIPS of ~0.1 on his AVR 2560 (or "10 times slower").

A Teensy 4.1, on the stock 600MHz and regular optimisation, clocks in at a whopping 3.33 MIPS! But to be honest, doesn't feel that much faster. The more impressive thing is that disk access is so much faster due to the buffered SDIO mechanism. The biggest trade off is that the Teensy gets REAALLY hot. For curiousity I changed it to be fastest optimisation and the full 1GHz, and it only went up to 3.7 MIPS, so you could probably use the underclocks and get it to somewhere a bit more balanced. At 150MHz and fastest optimisation you get 0.66 MIPS like the samd51 and it stays cooler; warm but not excessive.

For comparison, simh running my modified unix on an RPi 3B+ clocks in at 2 MIPS with the timing throttle turned off.
