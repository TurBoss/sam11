# Ultimate goals

  * Be able to boot BSD 2.11
  * Run DEC's XXDP Diagnostics without errors on the implemented modules...

# Long Term

  * Get 11/45 emulation working properly (even just on UNIX V6)
  * Add support for more disk drives, e.g. RP
  * Add support for magenetic tape drives
  * Add support for pushing the UNIBUS requests into IO to allow co-processsor emulation of various hardware (and maybe real cards...?)
  * Add networking via DELUA or DEUNA (needs BSDs)

# Short Term

  * Finish adding KY11 IO and stuff to get a front panel
  * Finish adding DL11 TTY/Serials -> and route via platform.cpp for options
  * Finish work on adding RL drive
  * Finish adding FP11
  * Add CPU registers and FIS, EIS to the UNIBUS

# Bug/Feature Fixes

## KD11/KB11

  * Add Yellow/Red Traps
  * Get stack limit register so it actually does *something*
  * Fix instruction faults/bugs -> e.g. Unix V6 "BC" program
  * Fix interrupts -> how many in list? DOS 11 runs out somehow

## RK11

  * Finish adding as-yet-unimplemented features

## KT11

  * Finish off KT11's registers so back steps work on traps
