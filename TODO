# Ultimate goals

  * Be able to boot and run BSD 2.11 without any issues
  * Run DEC's XXDP Diagnostics without errors on the implemented/enabled modules...

# Long Term

  * Get 11/45 emulation working properly (even just on UNIX V6)
  * Add support for more storage/interfaces
  * Add support for magenetic tape drives
  * Add support for pushing the UNIBUS requests into IO to allow co-processsor emulation of various hardware (and maybe real cards...?)
      * Look into QBUS64 as a possible pinout.
  * Add networking via DELUA or DEUNA (needs BSDs), possibly NI1010A instead as it's simpler and actually documented...
  * Add some sort of simh-like boot.ini and setup/mount for drives, interfaces, etc.

# Short Term

  * Finish adding KY11 IO and stuff to get a front panel
  * Finish adding DL11 TTY/Serials -> and route via platform.cpp for options
  * ~~Finish work on adding RL drive~~ Not worth it? you can run an RL disk image in an RP drive (apparently)
  * Add RP disk drive -> RL disks can be driven as RP disks 0-4, but will ID as small-size RP disks in OSes
  * Finish adding FP11
  * Get BSD 2.9 RK05 image running

# Bug/Feature Fixes

## DD11

  * Add CPU registers and FIS, EIS to the UNIBUS
      * This is to allow it to support software which acceses them that way

## KD11/KB11

  * Add Yellow/Red Traps
  * Get stack limit register so it actually does *something*
  * Fix instruction faults/bugs -> e.g. Unix V6 "BC" program
      * This seems to be a fault with Unix... maybe. The BC program sometimes calls up an invalid instruction 007600, this isn't even part of the CIS or DIS.
  * Fix interrupts -> how many in list? DOS 11 runs out somehow (possbily because the RK05 interrupts instantly and they expect a few instructions between disk activity and an interrupt)

## RK11

  * Finish adding as-yet-unimplemented features, errors, etc.

## KT11

  * Finish off KT11's registers so back steps work on traps
