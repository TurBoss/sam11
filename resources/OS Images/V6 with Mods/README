This is the unixv6.dsk image from the main OS image directory with a couple of tweaks:

1. Added a couple of users, along with login and logout scripts
2. Added some extra tools/programs from 2BSD (inc. csh, whoami)
3. Added the "em" editor, a predecessor of vi/ex which was designed for V6 (and not V7 like 2BSD's Ex)
4. Added terminal clear and reset commands
5. Added shutdown and halt commands (must have processor modded to enable user halt)
